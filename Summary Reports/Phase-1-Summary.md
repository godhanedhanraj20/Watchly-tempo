# Phase 1 Summary Report – Foundations & UI System

## Key findings
- The visual system emphasizes a dark, cinematic baseline with high-contrast CTAs and subtle elevation.
- Core UI building blocks are reusable across landing, dashboard, and room flows, so front-loading the component kit reduces future rework.
- Feedback states (loading, syncing, permission denied) need a consistent visual language early to keep the product calm and reassuring.

## Outcomes
- Established the Phase 1 scope (design tokens, primitives, overlays, layout shell, and loaders).
- Created a detailed, day-by-day execution plan and a checklist for tracking completion.
- Organized Phase 1 update documentation for easy access and reference.

## Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Inconsistent contrast on dark theme components.
  - **Mitigation:** Validate tokens against WCAG targets during Day 1 token definition.
- **Risk:** Modal and toast patterns drift in spacing or elevation.
  - **Mitigation:** Centralize elevation tokens and enforce a shared overlay baseline.

## Next steps
- Execute Phase 1 checklist in order.
- Capture a UI kit snapshot after Day 5 to align design and engineering.
